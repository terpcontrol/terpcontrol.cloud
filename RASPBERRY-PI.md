# Running the server on a Raspberry Pi

> **Note:** This project is designed for **Raspberry Pi 4 (or newer)** with a **64-bit OS**.

Running this stack on a Raspberry Pi 3 or older is **not supported** due to the following technical limitations:

### 1. Architecture (64-bit / ARM64)
Modern Docker images for **MongoDB** and **InfluxDB** have dropped support for 32-bit (ARMv7) architectures. 
* **Issue:** Raspberry Pi 3 often runs on a 32-bit OS, leading to `no matching manifest` errors.
* **Solution:** A Raspberry Pi 4 (or 5) running **64-bit Raspberry Pi OS** is required for full compatibility.

### 2. RAM Constraints
This stack runs multiple resource-heavy database services (MongoDB + InfluxDB) simultaneously. 
* **RPi 3:** Limited to **1 GB RAM**, causing "Out of Memory" (OOM) crashes and heavy SD-card swapping.
* **RPi 4/5:** Available with **4GB/8GB RAM**, providing the necessary headroom for stable database operations and efficient caching.

### Recommended Setup
| Component | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hardware** | Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB+ RAM) |
| **OS** | Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) |
| **Storage** | USB 3.0 SSD (Highly recommended for DB longevity) |



1. `cd myfolder`
1. `git clone https://github.com/novazer/fg2.git`
1. `cd fg2/`
1. `cp .env.sample .env`
1. `vi .env` (or edit this file in any other way)
1. `wget https://github.com/themattman/mongodb-raspberrypi-docker/releases/download/r7.0.4-mongodb-raspberrypi-docker-unofficial/mongodb.ce.pi4.r7.0.4-mongodb-raspberrypi-docker-unofficial.tar.gz`
2. `docker load --input mongodb.ce.pi4.r7.0.4-mongodb-raspberrypi-docker-unofficial.tar.gz`
1. Add the following line to your `.env` file to use the unofficial MongoDB image for Raspberry Pi:
   ```
   DOCKER_MONGODB_IMAGE=mongodb-raspberrypi4-unofficial-r7.0.4:latest
   DOCKER_MONGODATA_EXTERNAL=true
   DOCKER_MONGODATA_VOLUME=mongodata
   DOCKER_INFLUXDATA_EXTERNAL=true
   DOCKER_INFLUXDATA_VOLUME=influxdata
   ```
1. `docker volume create mongodata`
1. `docker volume create influxdata`
1. `./up.sh`
1. Go to `http://<youripOrDomain>:8080` to access the web interface
1. Now continue with the [Firmware building](README.md#firmware-building) steps to build and upload your custom firmware.

Please note that the `backup.sh` and `restore.sh` scripts are not compatible with the Raspberry Pi setup due to 
differences in the MongoDB image used. You will need to perform backups and restores manually. See
[backing up and restoring data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/#back-up-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes)
for more information on how to do this. The volumes are named `mongodata` and `influxdata` as specified in the `.env` file.
(You should run  `./stop.sh` before backing up or restoring to ensure data consistency.)

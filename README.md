## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git
- A new firmware, that has the "Change server" option (see [Upgrading an older firmware](UPGRADING-FIRMWARE.md) if you don't have this)

### Quickstart
1. `cd myfolder`
1. `git clone https://github.com/novazer/fg2.git`
1. `cd fg2/`
1. `cp .env.sample .env`
1. `vi .env` (or edit this file in any other way) 
1. `docker compose up --build -d --remove-orphans`
1. Go to `http://<youripOrDomain>:8080` to access the web interface

### Firmware building
Before being able to connect the module to your server, you need to build a custom firmware. This firmware contains the 
server url specified in your .env file.
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
1. `./build-fw.sh`
1. Now you can use the "Change server" option in the module to flash the firmware to your module. You'll need to input 
   the `API_URL_EXTERNAL` and the `SELF_REGISTRATION_PASSWORD` values from your `.env` file with the knob.
1. If the operation failed, it will display "connecting..." after pressing a button. This will not disappear until you 
   restart the module. 

### Upgrading / Restarting
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
1. `git pull` (optional: this gets you the latest changes from the repo)
1. `docker compose up --build -d --remove-orphans`
1. `./build-fw.sh` (if you want to update the firmware as well)

## MQTT transport

The broker exposes two MQTT listeners:
- **1883 (plaintext)** — always available, kept for legacy firmware that cannot speak TLS.
- **8883 (MQTTS / TLS)** — enabled when a cert/key are supplied via config.

To enable MQTTS, run:

```sh
./scripts/setup-mqtts.sh
```

It reads `MQTT_HOST_EXTERNAL` from `.env`, generates a fresh RSA cert/key pair (CN/SAN
matches what devices connect to), and writes the base64-encoded PEM values for
`MQTTS_CERT_PEM_B64`, `MQTTS_KEY_PEM_B64`, and `MQTTS_CA_PEM_B64` into `.env`. Re-running
the script rotates the cert in place. Both broker listeners use the same HTTP auth
backend, so credentials and topic permissions apply identically.

`build-fw.sh` reads the same `.env`: when `MQTTS_CA_PEM_B64` is present it bakes the CA
into the firmware build and points the device at the MQTTS port instead of the plaintext
one. OTAing this firmware switches the device's MQTT transport to TLS on its next
connect. If `MQTTS_CA_PEM_B64` is empty, the broker starts plaintext-only and the
firmware build keeps using the plaintext listener — existing deployments stay
backward-compatible by simply not configuring it.

## Management

### Admin tools
After running, you can access the management tools:
- http://localhost:8072 - RabbitMQ Management (guest, guest)
- http://localhost:8088 - Mongo Express (admin, pass)
- http://localhost:8086 - InfluxDB UI (*see `.env`*)

### Backup
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
2. `./backup.sh`

This produces two files that are both needed, e.g.
```
backup-2025-10-29_22-12-27.influxdump
backup-2025-10-29_22-12-27.mongodump
```

Additionally, you may want to back up the `.env` file as well.

### Restore
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
2. Place the backup files here
2. `docker compose stop server`
2. `./restore.sh backup-2025-10-29_22-12-27`
2. `docker compose up -d`
3. It may be necessary to create a new firmware version. Run `./build-fw.sh` if needed.

## Cleanup
To remove all data and start fresh:
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
2. `docker compose down --volumes`
4. `cd ../`
5. `rm -rf fg2/`
6. When starting fresh, you'll also need to use the module's "Change server" again, as this registers the module in the 
   server again.

## Development

### Frontend

1. `cd webapp/`
2. `npm install`
3. Optional: Edit `src/environments/environment.ts` to point to `https://fg2.novazer.com/api` for easier testing.
4. `npm start`

And before committing:
1. `npm run lint:fix`
1. `npm run build`

### Backend

1. `cd server/`
2. `npm install`
3. Set all required environment variables (see the server's environment variables in `docker-compose.yaml`).
4. `npm start`

And before committing:
1. `npm run lint:fix`
2. `npm run build`

### Firmware

Make sure that the following environment variables are set in `.env`:
```
API_URL_EXTERNAL=https://fg2.novazer.com/api
MQTT_HOST_EXTERNAL=fg2.novazer.com
MQTT_PORT_EXTERNAL=4883
```

(Adjust them as needed if you want to host the server yourself.)

Then try running `./provision-fw.sh fridge` to build a firmware for the fridge module and provision it via USB.

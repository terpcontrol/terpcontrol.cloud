## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git
- A new firmware, that has the "Change server" option (see [Upgrading an older firmware](UPGRADING-FIRMWARE.md) if you don't have this)

### Quickstart
1. `cd myfolder`
1. `git clone https://github.com/novazer/fg2.git`
1. `cd fg2/`
1. `cp .env.sample .env`
1. `vi .env` (or edit this file in any other way) 
1. `docker compose up --build -d --remove-orphans`
1. Go to `http://<youripOrDomain>:8080` to access the web interface

### Firmware building
Before being able to connect the module to your server, you need to build a custom firmware. This firmware contains the 
server url specified in your .env file.
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
1. `./build-fw.sh`
1. Now you can use the "Change server" option in the module to flash the firmware to your module. You'll need to input 
   the `API_URL_EXTERNAL` and the `SELF_REGISTRATION_PASSWORD` values from your `.env` file with the knob.
1. If the operation failed, it will display "connecting..." after pressing a button. This will not disappear until you 
   restart the module. 

### Upgrading / Restarting
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
1. `git pull` (optional: this gets you the latest changes from the repo)
1. `docker compose up --build -d --remove-orphans`
1. `./build-fw.sh` (if you want to update the firmware as well)

## MQTT transport

The broker exposes two MQTT listeners:
- **1883 (plaintext)** — always available, kept for legacy firmware that cannot speak TLS.
- **8883 (MQTTS / TLS)** — enabled automatically when broker certificates are present.

To enable MQTTS, place `server.crt` and `server.key` (optionally `ca.crt`) in the
directory referenced by `MQTTS_CERTS_DIR` (default `./rabbitmq/certs`). See
[`rabbitmq/certs/README.md`](rabbitmq/certs/README.md) for how to generate a self-signed
certificate for testing. Both listeners use the same HTTP auth backend, so credentials
and topic permissions apply identically. If no certs are supplied, the broker starts with
the plaintext listener only.

## Management

### Admin tools
After running, you can access the management tools:
- http://localhost:8072 - RabbitMQ Management (guest, guest)
- http://localhost:8088 - Mongo Express (admin, pass)
- http://localhost:8086 - InfluxDB UI (*see `.env`*)

### Backup
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
2. `./backup.sh`

This produces two files that are both needed, e.g.
```
backup-2025-10-29_22-12-27.influxdump
backup-2025-10-29_22-12-27.mongodump
```

Additionally, you may want to back up the `.env` file as well.

### Restore
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
2. Place the backup files here
2. `docker compose stop server`
2. `./restore.sh backup-2025-10-29_22-12-27`
2. `docker compose up -d`
3. It may be necessary to create a new firmware version. Run `./build-fw.sh` if needed.

## Cleanup
To remove all data and start fresh:
1. `cd myfolder/fg2/`
2. `docker compose down --volumes`
4. `cd ../`
5. `rm -rf fg2/`
6. When starting fresh, you'll also need to use the module's "Change server" again, as this registers the module in the 
   server again.

## Development

### Frontend

1. `cd webapp/`
2. `npm install`
3. Optional: Edit `src/environments/environment.ts` to point to `https://fg2.novazer.com/api` for easier testing.
4. `npm start`

And before committing:
1. `npm run lint:fix`
1. `npm run build`

### Backend

1. `cd server/`
2. `npm install`
3. Set all required environment variables (see the server's environment variables in `docker-compose.yaml`).
4. `npm start`

And before committing:
1. `npm run lint:fix`
2. `npm run build`

### Firmware

Make sure that the following environment variables are set in `.env`:
```
API_URL_EXTERNAL=https://fg2.novazer.com/api
MQTT_HOST_EXTERNAL=fg2.novazer.com
MQTT_PORT_EXTERNAL=4883
```

(Adjust them as needed if you want to host the server yourself.)

Then try running `./provision-fw.sh fridge` to build a firmware for the fridge module and provision it via USB.
